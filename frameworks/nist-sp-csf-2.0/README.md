* Govern (GV): This is like setting the rules and making sure everyone understands the security strategy, expectations, and policies. It’s the leadership and oversight part.
* Identify (ID): Knowing what you have (your digital assets) and understanding the cybersecurity risks you face is crucial
* Protect (PR): Putting safeguards in place to manage those risks and prevent incidents from happening in the first place
* Detect (DE): Continuously looking for signs of attacks and potential problems
* Respond (RS): Taking action when an incident is detected. This includes managing, prioritizing, containing, and getting rid of the threat, as well as communicating about it
* Recover (RC): Restoring your systems and operations after an incident

### Roles and Responsibilities

Here’s a cheat sheet summarizing **Incident Response Roles and Responsibilities** in a tabular format:

| **Incident Handlers**                       | Verify incidents, collect/analyze data, prioritize activities, mitigate damage, and restore operations.          | On-staff team, contracted MSSPs, or on-call personnel.          |
| **Technology Professionals**                | Involved in cybersecurity, privacy, system/network architecture, and recovery efforts.                           | Architects, engineers, administrators, software developers.     |
| **Legal**                                   | Ensures compliance with laws/regulations, reviews contracts, and provides legal guidance.                        | Legal experts and advisors.                                     |
| **Public Affairs**                          | Manages communication with media and public during incidents.                                                    | Public relations and media engagement personnel.                |
| **Human Resources**                         | Handles pre-employment screening, onboarding/offboarding, and employee conduct investigations.                   | HR department.                                                  |
| **Physical Security**                       | Addresses physical breaches/logical attacks and facilitates access to compromised facilities.                    | Security and facilities management teams.                       |
| **Asset Owners**                            | Provide insights on priorities for affected assets and stay updated on response progress.                        | System owners, data owners, and business process owners.        |
| **Third-Party Providers**                   | Perform incident detection/response, define shared responsibilities, and mitigate risks (e.g., insider threats). | MSSPs, CSPs, ISPs, and contracted service providers.            |

### Incident Response Policies, Processes and Procedures

"Organizations need tailored cybersecurity incident response policies, typically covering key elements."

* Statement of management commitment
* &#x20;Purpose and objectives of the policy
*  Scope of the policy (i.e., to whom and what it applies and under what circumstances
* Definition of events, cybersecurity incidents, investigations, and related terms
* &#x20;Roles, responsibilities, and authorities, such as which roles have the authority to  \
  confiscate, disconnect, or shut down technology assets
* &#x20;Guidelines for prioritizing incidents, estimating their severity, initiating recovery  \
  processes, maintaining or restoring operations, and other key actions
* &#x20;Performance measures

<mark style="color:purple;">**CSF 2.0 Community Profile for Cyber Incident Risk Management**</mark>

A CSF Community Profile is a baseline of CSF outcomes that is created and published to address\
shared interests and goals for reducing cybersecurity risk among a number of organizations. A\
Community Profile is typically developed for a particular sector, subsector, technology, threat\
type, or other use case \[CSF2.0].

* **Purpose**: Defines NIST CSF 2.0 Community Profile for cyber incident risk management.
* **Core Framework**: Uses CSF Core to prioritize cybersecurity outcomes for incident response.
* **Structure**:
  * **Table 2**: Covers Preparation (Govern, Identify, Protect) and Lessons Learned (Identify-Improvement).
  * **Table 3**: Focuses on Incident Response (Detect, Respond, Recover).
* **Priority Levels**:
  * **High**: Core incident response activities.
  * **Medium**: Direct support for incident response.
  * **Low**: Indirect support for incident response.
* **Customizable Profiles**: Organizations are encouraged to adapt the profiles to meet their specific needs.
* **Annotations**:
  * **R**: Recommendations (mandatory actions).
  * **C**: Considerations (optional actions).
  * **N**: Notes (additional information).
* **Unique Identifiers**: Each annotation is appended to a CSF ID, e.g., `GV.OC-03.R1`.
* **Applicability**: Recommendations, considerations, and notes apply broadly to Functions, Categories, and Subcategories.
* **Supplementary Resources**: Provides additional documents and online tools to support CSF outcomes.
* **Updates**: Technologies and terms mentioned may become outdated; organizations should define terms based on context, laws, and regulations.
* **Audience**: Applicable to organizations across all sectors and sizes; versions for narrower audiences may be developed.
