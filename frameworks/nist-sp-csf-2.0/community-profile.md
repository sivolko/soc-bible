# 🖲️ Community Profile

> Most of the CSF elements in this part of the Profile are not> \
> specific to executing incident response activities, so they have lower> \
> priorities with respect to incident response and do not contain> \
> recommendations or considerations. This does not imply that they are> \
> unnecessary for organizations to achieve, but rather that they are> \
> outside of the direct scope of responding to incidents.
